In Praise of the Three Jewels
by Ācārya Vasubandhu

In the language of India: Triratnastotra
In the language of Tibet: Könchok sum gyi töpa (dkon mchog gsum gyi bstod pa)

Homage to the Three Jewels!

mikmé chö kyi ku
To the referenceless dharmakāya,
longchö dzokpé ku
The kāya of perfect enjoyment,
chiryang tulku la
And the kāya of diverse manifestion,
güpé chaktsal lo
In devotion, I pay homage.

namdak chö kyi ying
To the utterly pure dharmadhātu,
drubpé paklam gyé
The eighfold noble path of practice,
tenpé sung rab la
And the excellent speech of the teachings,
güpé chaktsal lo
In devotion, I pay homage.

changchub sem nam dang
To the bodhisattvas,
drachom dak la sok
The arhats and so on,
rang sangyé nam la
And the pratyekabuddhas,
güpé chaktsal lo
In devotion, I pay homage.

This concludes the Praise of the Three Jewels by Ācārya Vasubandhu.
